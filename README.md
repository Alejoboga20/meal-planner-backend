# Meal-Planner-Backend

Welcome to GPT-Meal-Planner, a meal planning application with a Node.js server and a React client.

## Project Overview

GPT-Meal-Planner is a web application designed to help users plan their meals efficiently. It consists of two main components:

1. **GPT-Meal-Planner Server**: The backend component of the application built with Node.js, TypeScript, and NestJS. This server handles user requests, manages meal data, and provides API endpoints for the client.

2. **GPT-Meal-Planner Client**: The frontend component of the application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The client provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for meal planning and recipe management.

## Server

The server folder contains the backend component of the application. It provides the necessary API endpoints to interact with the client and manage meal data. To get started with the server, refer to the [Server README](./server/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## Client

The client folder contains the frontend component of the application. It offers a delightful user experience for planning meals and managing recipes. To get started with the client, refer to the [Client README](./client/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
